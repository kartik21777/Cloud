Binaries: This term refers to files that can be executed, similar to executables in Windows. Binaries generally reside in the /usr/bin or usr/sbin directory and include utilities such as ps, cat, ls, and cd as well as applications such as the wireless hacking tool aircrack-ng and the intrusion detection system (IDS) Snort. Linux is case sensitive. This means that Desktop is different from desktop, which is different from DeskTop.
Home: Each user has their own /home directory, and this is generally where files you create will be saved by default.
root: Like nearly every operating system, Linux has an administrator or superuser account, designed for use by a trusted person who can do nearly anything on the system. This would include such things as reconfiguring the system, adding users, and changing passwords. In Linux, that account is called root.
Script This is a series of commands run in an interpretive environment that converts each line to source code. Scripts can be run with the bash interpreter or any of the other scripting language interpreters, such as Python, Perl, or Ruby.
Shell This is an environment and interpreter for running commands in Linux. The most widely used shell is bash, which stands for Bourne-again shell, but other popular shells include the C shell and Z shell.
